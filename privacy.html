    <b>Preamble</b>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy ("Policy") informs Users of our policies regarding the
      processing of personal information we receive from users of the
      threelab.dev and its related services (the "Website", "us", "we", or
      "our"). We use your personal information only for providing and improving
      the Website. By using the Website you agree to the collection, store and
      use of information in accordance with this Policy.
    </p>
    <b>Types of Personal Information</b>
    <p>While providing our services we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP address;</li>
      <li>
        Information you may provide to us: Your email address, virtual currency
        addresses, mobile phone number, alias, password and any other
        information you choose to provide;
      </li>
      <li>Cookies;</li>
      <li>
        Your mobile devices you use with the Website may provide some
        information that may potentially identify you, such as the type
        (including identifiers) of the device, platform type, mobile phone
        number, your internet service, operating system, geolocation
        information, browser you use, browser language, or the pages you visit.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Website may provide some of your behavior information, such as your
        visiting the Website, clicking on ads or other similar information. Such
        information may be received with additional related data (or metadata),
        such as the time, date, and location related to such information.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wallet Address Information. When you create a wallet through our
        services, an encrypted private key pair is automatically generated and
        stored via our services. Under no circumstances do we ever collect an
        unencrypted private key from you. However, we can use hashed and
        encrypted information about your private key and mnemonic phrase in pair
        with your e-mail in order to be able to grant you access to your wallet.
      </li>
      <li>
        By voluntarily providing us with personal data, including without
        limitation by using the Website, you expressly and irrevocably agree to
        our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide
        personal data to us, you acknowledge and agree that such personal data
        may be transferred from your current location to the servers of
        threelab.dev and to the servers of authorized third parties.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <b>How We Use Your Information</b>
    <p>
      We use the information we collect to provide, maintain, protect and
      improve our services, to develop new ones and to protect our users. We
      also use this information to offer you the best content and may use your
      personally identifiable information and your device information in order
      to offer you relevant (targeted) adds. You agree that we may share and
      transfer your information which no longer identifies you to the third
      party who is contracting party with us, usually our services providers or
      advertising partners.
    </p>
    <b>How We Protect Your Information</b>
    <p>
      We strive to protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or
      disclosure. We use a variety of physical and technical measures designed
      to protect our systems and your personal information. Unfortunately, there
      is no such thing as completely secure data transmission or storage, so we
      cannot guarantee that our security will not be breached (by technical
      measures or through violation of our policies and procedures). Without
      prejudice to our efforts on protection of your information nothing herein
      constitute a warranty of security of the Website, and you agree to
      transmit information at your own risk. Please note, that the Website does
      not guarantee that your information may not be accessed, disclosed,
      altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or
      managerial safeguards.
